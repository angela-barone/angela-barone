### Hi there üëã



üòÑ  I'm currently a candidate for the Code First Girls Degree in Full-Stack Development

üéì  I am a Law and Finance graduate currently switching to Tech. I hope to become a DevOps Engineer or a Full-Stack Developer! 

üå±  I‚Äôm on track for learning more about C#, .NET, ReactJS, Python, TypeScript and Cloud Architecture.

üî≠  I'm currently enrolled in the Codecademy's C# course and the Web Development one organized by Code First Girls.

‚úçÔ∏è  I have already completed multiple courses on Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

‚ö°  Fun fact: I speak Italian, English, French, Spanish, a little bit of Chinese and Korean.
